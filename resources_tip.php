    <h1><u>Top 7 Pro Thrift Tips</u></h1>
    <p>#1 Go in with an open mind! Stores are full of gems you may not have been looking for.</p>
    <p>#2 Never rule out a size or length. Sizes have changed over time and hemming, and remember alterations are always an option.</p>
    <p>#3 Shop off-season. Less people buy off-season and more people get rid of off-season items.</p>
    <p>#4 Use discretion in what you buy. Although items are cheap, prices add up!</p>
    <p>#5 Don’t give up. Thrift shops are hit or miss by nature, so don’t get discouraged by a miss.</p>
    <p>#6 Donate your clothes. One man’s trash is another man’s treasure.</p>
    <p>#7 Most importantly, HAVE FUN!!!</p>
