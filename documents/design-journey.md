## Client Description

[Tell us about your client. Who is your client? What kind of website do they want? What are their key goals?]

[NOTE: If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site. Tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the final project requirements.]

Our client is Cornell Thrift. They want a website for cornell students interested in the club activities: the events
they hosting and the organization mission. Their key goals are to have a new website that uses the content of
their existing website with newly added features, such as forms for updating current event, forms for sign up
for mailing list, image gallery.


## Meeting Notes

[By this point, you have met once with your client to discuss all their requirements. Include your notes from the meeting, an email they sent you, or whatever you used to keep track of what was discussed at the meeting. Include these artifacts here.]

## Purpose & Content

[Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.]
The purpose of the website is to promote Cornell Thrift and have Cornell students know the upcoming
events that Cornell Thrift is hosting.


## Target Audience(s)

[Tell us about the potential audience for this website. How, when, and where would they interact with the website? Get as much detail as possible from the client to help you find representative users.]

The potential audience for this website are members of the club and people at Cornell who are intersted in what Cornell Thrift do. The target audiences will be able to find mission of the club and more information (image and position) about eboard members. Also, they can look for the upcoming events/activities such as 'Thrift Exchange Closets' or 'Pop-up Shop'. For anyone who would like to be part of the club can subscribe for newsletter, they can fill out the form. Only Eboard members will be able to upload/delete events and gallery.


## Client Requirements & Target Audiences' Needs

[Collect your client's needs and wants for the website. Come up with several appropriate design ideas on how those needs may be met. In the **Rationale** field, justify your ideas and add any additional comments you have. There is no specific number of needs required for this, but you need enough to do the job.]

## Interactivity

[What interactive features will your site have? What PHP elements will you include?]
* We have a login/logout page for the E-board members of Cornell Thrift. The login/logout link will appear on the top right of each page.
* If a E-board member of Cornell Thrift is logged in, then he or she can upload new pictures and update events(make changes to the website)
* We have a contact form where people can put in their name and email address and write a message to the Cornell Thrift club.
* Under each page, we will have a form that says "Sign up for the mailling list" and takes in people's email

[Also, describe how the interactivity connects with the needs of the clients/target audience.]
* The login and logout functionality will make sure that Cornell Thrift's E-board members can edit their website and upload new contents which is what our client wants.
* The contact form allows people who are interested in Cornell Thrift to interact with the Eboard members which is what our client wants.
* The mailling list sign up would allow people who are interest in Cornell Thrift to get more information about this club which is what our client wants to happen.

## Work Distribution

[Describe how each of your responsibilities will be distributed among your group members.]

[Set internal deadlines. Determine your internal dependencies. Whose task needs to be completed first in order for another person's task to be relevant? Be specific in your task descriptions so that everyone knows what needs to be done and can track the progress effectively. Consider how much time will be needed to review and integrate each other's work. Most of all, make sure that tasks are balanced across the team.]

Milestone 1

Initial Sketches
- Home - Susan
- About - Yuyi
- Our Events - Samantha
- Thrifting Resources - Ha Yeon

- Clive - Organize a second client meeting in advance of the Milestone 2 deadline

- Everyone is responsible for updating their own pseudocode, structure, and initial coding for each page/template as assigned above.

- The whole team will work together at the two team meetings to plan the database, update the design, and finish any other elements of the milestone not specified above.

Milestone 3

- Samantha - Organize a team meeting to work on the init.sql file to implement the database

## Additional Comments

[If you feel like you haven't fully explained your design choices, or if you want to explain some other functions in your site (such as special design decisions that might not meet the final project requirements), you can use this space to justify your design choices or ask other questions about the project and process.]


--- <!-- ^^^ Milestone 1; vvv Milestone 2 -->

## Client Feedback

[Share the feedback notes you received from your client about your initial design.]


## Iterated Design

[Improve your design based on the feedback you received from your client.]


## Evaluate your Design

[Use the GenderMag method to evaluate your wireframes.]

[Pick a persona that you believe will help you address the gender bias within your design.]

I've selected **[Abby/Patricia/Patrick/Tim]** as my persona.

I've selected my persona because... [Tell us why you picked your persona in 1-3 sentences. Your explanation should include why your persona will help you address gender-inclusiveness bugs in your design.]

### Tasks

[You will need to evaluate at least 2 tasks (known as scenarios in the GenderMag literature). List your tasks here. These tasks are the same as the task you learned in INFO/CS 1300.]

[For each task, list the ideal set of actions that you would like your users to take when working towards the task.]

Task 1: [describe your task]

  1. [action 1...]
  2. [action 2...]
  3. ...

Task 2:


### Cognitive Walkthrough

[Perform a cognitive walkthrough using the GenderMag method for all of your Tasks. Use the GenderMag template in the <documents/gendermag-template.md> file.]

#### Task 1 - Cognitive Walkthrough

[copy the GenderMag template here and conduct a cognitive walkthrough to evaluate your design (wireframes).]

[You may need to add additional subgoals and/or actions for each task.]


#### Task 2 - Cognitive Walkthrough


### Cognitive Walk-though Results

[Did you discover any issues with your design? What were they? How will you change your design to address the gender-inclusiveness bugs you discovered?]

[Your responses here should be **very** thorough and thoughtful.]


## Final Design

[Include sketches of your finalized design.]

[What changes did you make to your final design based on the results on your cognitive walkthrough?]


## Database Schema

[Describe the structure of your database. You may use words or a picture. A bulleted list is probably the simplest way to do this.]

Table: movies
* field 1: description...
* field...


## Database Queries

[Plan your database queries. You may use natural language, pseudocode, or SQL.]


## PHP File Structure

[List the PHP files you will have. You will probably want to do this with a bulleted list.]

* index.php - main page.
* includes/init.php - stuff that useful for every web page.
* TODO


## Pseudocode

[For each PHP file, plan out your pseudocode. You probably want a subheading for each file.]

### index.php

```
Pseudocode for index.php...

include init.php

TODO
```


## Additional Comments

[Add any additional comments you have here.]

[Tell us about any issues or challenges you faced while trying to complete milestone 3. Bullet points preferred.]


--- <!-- ^^^ Milestone 3; vvv FINAL SUBMISSION-->

## Final Notes to the Clients

[Include any other information that your client needs to know about your final website design. For example, what client wants or needs were unable to be realized in your final product? Why were you unable to meet those wants/needs?]


## Final Notes to the Graders

[1. Give us three specific strengths of your site that sets it apart from the previous website of the client (if applicable) and/or from other websites. Think of this as your chance to argue for the things you did really well.]
